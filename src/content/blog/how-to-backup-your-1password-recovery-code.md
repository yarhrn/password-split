Your 1Password recovery code is one of the most critical pieces of information for accessing your password vault. If you lose access to your account and don't have your recovery code, you could be permanently locked out of all your passwords. Password Split provides a secure way to backup your recovery code by splitting it into multiple parts.

## Why Backup Your Recovery Code?

- **Account Recovery**: If you lose access to your primary authentication method
- **Device Loss**: When your trusted devices are lost or damaged
- **Emergency Access**: Ensure you can always recover your vault
- **Security**: Avoid storing the complete code in a single location

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access Your 1Password Manage Account

First, log into your account and select your account or collection at the top of the sidebar and choose Manage Accounts.

### Step 2: Choose Your Account

If you're signed in to multiple accounts, select your account that you want to set up recovery for.

### Step 6: Save the Generated Parts

Password Split will generate several parts of your recovery code. Save these parts in different secure locations - you can store them with trusted family members, in different physical locations, or in separate secure digital storage.

## Best Practices

- **Store parts separately**: Never keep all parts in the same location
- **Label clearly**: Make sure you can identify what each part is for
- **Test recovery**: Periodically verify you can reconstruct your code
- **Update backups**: If you change your recovery code, update all parts
- **Share wisely**: Only give parts to people you completely trust

## Security Benefits

Using Password Split for your 1Password recovery code provides several security advantages:

- **No single point of failure**: No one location contains your complete recovery code
- **Threshold security**: You need multiple parts to reconstruct the original code
- **Zero-knowledge**: Password Split doesn't store or transmit your sensitive data
- **Offline capable**: Works entirely in your browser for maximum security

## Conclusion

Backing up your 1Password recovery code with Password Split ensures you'll never lose access to your password vault while maintaining the highest level of security. By splitting your recovery code into multiple parts, you create a robust backup system that protects against both loss and unauthorized access.

Remember: your recovery code is as important as your master password. Take the time to back it up properly using Password Split's secure secret sharing technology.
