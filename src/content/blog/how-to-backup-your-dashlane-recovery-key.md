Your Dashlane recovery key is one of the most critical pieces of information for accessing your password vault. If you lose access to your account and don't have your recovery key, you could be permanently locked out of all your passwords. Password Split provides a secure way to backup your recovery key by splitting it into multiple parts.

## Why Backup Your Recovery Key?

- **Account Recovery**: If you lose access to your primary authentication method
- **Device Loss**: When your trusted devices are lost or damaged
- **Emergency Access**: Ensure you can always recover your vault
- **Security**: Avoid storing the complete key in a single location

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open Dashlane Web App

Select the Dashlane D icon in your browser's toolbar and enter your Master Password if prompted. Then in the extension pop-up, select Open the web app.

### Step 10: Save the Generated Parts

Password Split will generate several parts of your recovery key. Save these parts in different secure locations - you can store them with trusted family members, in different physical locations, or in separate secure digital storage.

## Best Practices

- **Store parts separately**: Never keep all parts in the same location
- **Label clearly**: Make sure you can identify what each part is for
- **Test recovery**: Periodically verify you can reconstruct your key
- **Update backups**: If you change your recovery key, update all parts
- **Share wisely**: Only give parts to people you completely trust

## Security Benefits

Using Password Split for your Dashlane recovery key provides several security advantages:

- **No single point of failure**: No one location contains your complete recovery key
- **Threshold security**: You need multiple parts to reconstruct the original key
- **Zero-knowledge**: Password Split doesn't store or transmit your sensitive data
- **Offline capable**: Works entirely in your browser for maximum security

## Conclusion

Backing up your Dashlane recovery key with Password Split ensures you'll never lose access to your password vault while maintaining the highest level of security. By splitting your recovery key into multiple parts, you create a robust backup system that protects against both loss and unauthorized access.

Remember: your recovery key is as important as your master password. Take the time to back it up properly using Password Split's secure secret sharing technology.
